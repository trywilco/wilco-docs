## **The Quest Creation Process**

1. Create a new repository by going to the [quest template](https://github.com/trywilco/quest-template){:target="_blank"} and clicking the "use this template" button. This template is a clone of the ["Funnel Drop" quest](https://app.wilco.gg/catalog/quest/mobile-responsiveness){:target="_blank"} and is fully playable as-is.
2. Update the files to support your new quest, according to the [quest development guidelines](https://github.com/trywilco/wilcosdk/tree/main/Quests%20Creation/Quest%20Development%20Guidelines):
    1. Make sure to modify the `id` in `quest.yml` and specify a unique quest identifier.
    2. Use the documentation to modify the quest metadata and the logic of the steps.

6. When the quest is ready, click the `submit for review` button. ([See: Review Process and Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/trywilco/wilcosdk/blob/Documentation_Quest_Guidelines/Quests%20Creation/Quest%20Development%20Guidelines/Review%20Process%20and%20Submission%20Guidelines))
7. Once a quest is approved, it will automatically be published to the Wilco Quest Catalog and become available to all Wilco users.


ðŸ’¡ To publish a quest only to users from your company, you'll need **Wilco for Teams**. Learn more [here](https://www.trywilco.com/teams/join).
