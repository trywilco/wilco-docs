# The Quest Creation Process

1. Create a new repository by going to the [quest template](https://github.com/trywilco/quest-template){:target="_blank"} and clicking the "use this template" button. This template is a clone of the ["Funnel Drop"](https://app.wilco.gg/catalog/quest/mobile-responsiveness){:target="_blank"} quest and is fully playable as-is.
2. Update the files to support your new quest, according to the [quest development guidelines]:
    a. Use the documentation to modify the quest metadata and the logic of the steps (See [Building Your Quest] section).
    b. Make sure to modify the `id` in `quest.yml` and specify a unique quest identifier.
3. Upload your quest to Wilco and test it in Snack (See [Uploading and Testing Your Quest] section).
4. When the quest is ready, click the `submit for review` button. Check out the [Review Process and Submission Guidelines] for more details
5. Once a quest is approved, it will automatically be published to the Wilco Quest Catalog and become available to all Wilco users.
