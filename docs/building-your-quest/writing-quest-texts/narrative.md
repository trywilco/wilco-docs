**Lucca** is an employee at Anythink and a co-worker of Vanessa and Navi. She is also Ness’s arch-enemy, at least in Ness’s eyes. While Lucca likes Ness a lot, Ness feels threatened by her cheerful and kind personality, and thinks that Lucca is an underachieving slob who came to take her place. Lucca is also pregnant, which is cool and important for representation. Main personality traits: warm, enthusiastic, and kind, yet a bit vain.

Ness: Oh, remember the old company retreat, near the lake? So many beautiful memories.

Lucca: I almost died drowning

Ness: As I said, so many beautiful memories

Ness: I hate to say it, but this sucks.

Lucca: It doesn't sound like you hate to say it.

Ness (about Lucca):

Why play so hard to get, when you're already so hard to want

Ness (to Lucca):

Ness: Hi Lucca,

Lucca: Yeah?

Ness: If I ever say: Do you want me to be honest? - Say no.

Users (trying to mess with us): I hate you.

Lucca: Why? I'm lovely.

Ness (to Lucca):

Ah, so you're the reason we have warning labels on everything.

Lucca: I had a thought.

Ness: Oh no.

Lucca: I swear it's a good one this time!

Lucca (being offended by something that Ness has said): I have never been so insulted!

Navi: You don't listen much, do you?

**Keen,** is a relatively new employee at Anythink, and a co-worker of Vanessa and Navi.

He’s full of interesting, yet very random tips, memories, and anecdotes about his homeland and how they did stuff there. Yet he’s completely aware and accustomed to the company traditions (I know what I wrote is almost a bit racist, but generally speaking, we’ll try to avoid using other “foreign guy” cliches and racism).

Keen gives vibes of India's secret service meets Russian KGB, being extra strict and suspicious sometimes, but then completely normal on other occasions.

Navi keeps trying to figure out where Keen is originally from, and is a bit suspicious of him and his goals.
