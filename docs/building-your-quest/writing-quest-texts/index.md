# Writing Quest Texts

## Narrative

When building a new quest, youâ€™ll be able to use one of the following characters to communicate with users: 

- [Lucca]
- [Keen]

To make your quest feel more like a conversation with a real human, make sure that conversation texts align with the voice and tone of each character. 

Adjust delay time between messages to make the speed of the conversation feel realistic and give users enough time to read each message. 

## Conversation Texts

When writing the conversation texts, it is best to read the texts aloud to yourself and ask yourself: 

- Are instructions worded clearly?
- Is all necessary information provided? (ex: definition of acronyms, links to information about terminology/concepts that may be unfamiliar to some users)
- Is there any extraneous text that can be cut out?
- Does the conversation read out as a dialogue or a long monologue?
- Is text formatted properly to highlight instructions, code, etc.? [Learn more]

## Hints
- Have you provided enough hints for each step? 
- Are the hints helpful? 

## Feedback 

The feedback users receive throughout the quest is not only an opportunity to let users know if they did something right or wrong. Frequent meaningful can help users stay engaged in the quest, point them in the right direction when they make a mistake and build their confidence.
