**Keen,** is a relatively new employee at Anythink, and a co-worker of Vanessa and Navi.

He’s full of interesting, yet very random tips, memories, and anecdotes about his homeland and how they did stuff there. Yet he’s completely aware and accustomed to the company traditions (I know what I wrote is almost a bit racist, but generally speaking, we’ll try to avoid using other “foreign guy” cliches and racism).

Keen gives vibes of India's secret service meets Russian KGB, being extra strict and suspicious sometimes, but then completely normal on other occasions.

Navi keeps trying to figure out where Keen is originally from, and is a bit suspicious of him and his goals.
