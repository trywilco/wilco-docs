# Quest Configuration

Every uploaded quest must include a file called `quest.yml` that configures the metadata of the quest, an `assets` folder with cover and logo images, and a `steps` folder with a yaml file for each step. In addition, a `tests` folder can be added with test files to be used by the steps.

```
