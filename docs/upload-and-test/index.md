# Uploading and Testing Your Quest

1. Create a zip file with the quest materials. You can use one of the following methods:
    
    A. Create a new release in your GitHub repository and download the zip asset generated for the release (see [managing releases in a repository]).
    
    B. Manually zip the files located on your local machine.
    
    C. [Auto-Upload Quest Drafts] using Github Workflow.
        
    {: .important }
    Make sure you have Quests Builder permissions in Wilco.
        
2. If you don't use auto-upload, please upload the zip file manually. Open the [Quest Builder] page, tap on the `upload new quest` button and select the zip file. If you're uploading a new version for an existing quest, find the quest in the list and click the `upload version` button.
3. Once the quest has finished uploading, click the `test quest in Snack` button and test the full quest flow.
